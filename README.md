### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an energetic and collaborative individual who is easy to work with. During my studies, I worked as a barman in various discos, which allowed me to develop strong communication and interpersonal skills. I hold a Master's degree in computer science and engineering and have over a year of experience as a Business Intelligence Engineer at Amazon.

In my current role, I use my technical expertise to collect and analyze data, providing insights that drive business decisions. I believe in the power of data-driven decision making and the value it brings to organizations.

Having lived in different countries, including Italy, Stockholm, Luxembourg, and Munich, I bring a global perspective to everything I do, which helps me adapt to new situations and work collaboratively with people from diverse backgrounds. I am committed to using my skills and experience to contribute to the success of any team I join.
